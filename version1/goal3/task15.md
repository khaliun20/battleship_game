## Task 15. Put it all together

Ok, when we say "put it all together" we really mean "put the placement checking
together with the rest of the program."

Go make BattleShipBoard's tryAddShip use the placementChecker.
Also update the default placementChecker in BattleShipBoard to use the
two checkers combined.

The only hint I'm going to give you is "dont forget about 'this'" (which is
the same as C++'s 'this').

Once you have done this, written test cases (to 100% coverage), and updated any documentation,
you are done with task 15!

Next up is Goal 4.
